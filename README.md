👋 Hi, I’m @sebacc224
👀 I’m interested in collaborating on projects related to data analysis, machine learning, and big data technologies.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in machine learning and data processing.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects, whether they are related to my field or not.
I am an industrial engineer from the Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, currently pursuing a specialization in Big Data. I have knowledge of Python programming, basics in SQL, and machine learning models. "The sky's the limit, even if we don't have wings to fly."
